# pyxel
>**py**thon library for e**x**perimental mechanics using finite **el**ements

**pyxel** is an open-source Finite Element (FE) Digital Image/Volume Correlation (DIC/DVC) library for experimental mechanics application. It is freely available for research and teaching.

In its present form, it is restricted to 2D-DIC and 3D-DVC. Stereo (SDIC) will be updated later. 
The gray level conservation problem is written in the physical space. It relies on camera models (which must be calibrated) and on a dedicated quadrature rule in the FE mesh space. Considering front-parallel camera settings, the implemented camera model is a simplified pinhole model (including only 4 parameters 2D: 2 translations, 1 rotation and the focal length and 7 parameters in 3D: focal length, 3 rotations, 3 translations) . More complex camera models (including distorsions) could easily be implemented within this framework (next update?). The library natively includes linear and quadratic triangles, quadrilateral, tetraedral, hexaedral elements. The library also exports the results in different format such that the measurements can be post-processed ether with MatPlotLib or using Paraview.

1. SCRIPT FILE
    - pyxel is a library. For each testcase, a script file must be written.
    - a set of sample scripts named `example_#.py` is provided in the `./data` folder
     to understand the main functionnalities of the library.

2. ABOUT MESHES
    - a mesh is entierly defined by two variables:
        (1) a python dictionnary for the elements (the key is the element type and the value is a numpy array of size NE * NN (NN being the number of nodes of this element type and NE the number of elements). The element type label (according to gmsh numbering). 
        example:
        ```python
	  e = dict()
       e[3] = np.array([[n0, n1, n2, n3]])
        ```
        (2) a numpy array n for the node coordinates, example:
        ```python
        n = np.array([[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ...])
        ```
    - There is an home made mesher for parallelipedic domains, given the approximate elements size in each direction (see examples). We recommand to use external meshers like, for instance, `gmsh`
    - To read/write the meshes, we rely on the library `meshio`. 

3. USING THE LIBRARY FOR A 2D ANALYSIS
    - Open the mesh: 
      ```python
      m = px.ReadMesh('mesh.msh')
      ```
    - Open the image:
      ```python
      f = px.Image('image.tif').Load()
      ```
    - Connectivity, quadrature, Interpolation:
      ```python
      m.Connectivity()
      m.DICIntegration(cam)
      ```      
    - Compute DIC approx. Hessian H and right hand side b:
      ```python
      dic = px.DICEngine()
      H = dic.ComputeLHS(f, m, cam)
      b, res = dic.ComputeRHS(g, m, cam, U)
      ```
4. OUTPUT FILES
    - It is possible to post-process the results directly using matplotlib.
       	but a more convenient way is to use Paraview www.paraview.org 
    - The library exports VTK files written in `./vtk` directory 
    - `*.vtu` files are generated, but it is also possible to generate 
      `*.pvd` files for use in paraview.
