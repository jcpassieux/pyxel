            Notice
        
        This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
        of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
        the two main principles guiding its drafting:
        
          * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
            of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
          * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
            is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
            property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
            holders of the economic rights over software.

            Preamble
        
        The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
        the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
        license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
        
        The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
        users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.
        
        In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
        modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
        with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
        economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
        
        In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
        and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
        the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
        complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
        developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
        knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
        suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
        enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
        more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
        security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
        provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
        removed herefrom.
        
        This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
        the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
        
        Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the
        CeCILL licenses family (http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html) for any 
        necessary clarification.

# pyxel
>**py**thon library for e**x**perimental mechanics using finite **el**ements

**pyxel** is an open-source Finite Element (FE) Digital Image/Volume Correlation (DIC/DVC) library for experimental mechanics application. It is freely available for research and teaching.

In its present form, it is restricted to 2D-DIC and 3D-DVC. Stereo (SDIC) will be updated later. 
The gray level conservation problem is written in the physical space. It relies on camera models (which must be calibrated) and on a dedicated quadrature rule in the FE mesh space. Considering front-parallel camera settings, the implemented camera model is a simplified pinhole model (including only 4 parameters 2D: 2 translations, 1 rotation and the focal length and 7 parameters in 3D: focal length, 3 rotations, 3 translations). More complex camera models (including distorsions) could easily be implemented within this framework (next update?). The library natively includes linear and quadratic triangles, quadrilateral, tetraedral, hexaedral elements. The library also exports the results in different format such that the measurements can be post-processed ether with MatPlotLib or using Paraview.

1. SCRIPT FILE
    - pyxel is a library. For each testcase, a script file must be written.
    - a set of sample scripts named `example_#.py` is provided in the `./test` folder
     to understand the main functionnalities of the library.

2. ABOUT MESHES
    - A Finite Element mesh is required for the displacement measurement. In pyxel, a mesh is entierly defined by two variables:<br>
        (1) a python dictionary for the elements (the key is the element type and the value is a numpy array of size NE * NN (NN being the number of nodes of this element type and NE the number of elements). The element type label (according to gmsh numbering). 
        example:
        ```python
	  e = dict()
       e[3] = np.array([[n0, n1, n2, n3]])
        ```
        (2) a numpy array n for the node coordinates, example:
        ```python
        n = np.array([[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ...])
        ```
    - There is an home made mesher for parallelipedic domains, given the approximate elements size in each direction (see examples). We recommand to use external meshers like, for instance, `gmsh`
    - To read/write the meshes, we use the usefull library `meshio`. 

3. MINIMAL SAMPLE CODE
    - to run a simple 2D-DIC analysis:
      ```python
      f = px.Image('img-0.tif').Load()
      g = px.Image('img-1.tif').Load()
      roi = np.array([[ 100,   100], [ 500,  500]])
      m, cam = px.MeshFromROI(roi, 50, typel=3)
      U, res = px.Correlate(f, g, m, cam)
      ```
    - A multiscale initialization is usually required
      ```python
      U = px.MultiscaleInit(f, g, m, cam, scales=[3, 2, 1], l0=30)
      ```
4. OUTPUT FILES
    - It is possible to post-process the results directly using matplotlib.
      ```python
      m.PlotContourDispl(U, s=30)
      ```
    - but a more convenient way (especially in DVC) is to use Paraview www.paraview.org 
      ```python
      m.VTKSol('vtufile', U)
      ```
